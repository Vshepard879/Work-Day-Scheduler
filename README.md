# Work Day Scheduler
 
 ## Description
Worked on by Vincent Shepard

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- Then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist

## Changes that were made
- Provided a concise title.
- integrated a dynamic start button that when clicked initiates the quiz
- Built the HTML framework, JavaScript functions, and CSS style sheets using tools I learned from past assignments 
- Updated the selectAnswer buttons to tell when a user chose a correct/incorrect answer
- Set up an array and function that randomizes the quiz questions as well as lets you proceed to the next question
- Set up a Timer that runs once the start button is clicked
- Made it so that when an incorrect answer was chosen using a JS function there was a penalization of 5 seconds
- Created an end screen, which was reached when all questions were answered or the timer hit zero
- Created a section on the end screen to input initials as well as save your high score
- Created a separate HTML and JS file for the score section which could be referenced to by pressing the high score button 
- Created and flushed out the README.
