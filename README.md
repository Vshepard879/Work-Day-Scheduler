# Work Day Scheduler
 
 ## Description
Worked on by Vincent Shepard

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- Then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist

## Changes that were made
- Provided a concise title.
- The work day calender displays the standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
- The top of the application displays the current day and date
- Created a clear day button that deletes the events written in the time boxes
- Set the boxes to be color coded for past, present, and future.
- tweaked the CSS from the base code for stylization.
- Each block contains an input field and save button that can be then stored in local storage.
- Created to work dynamically with both mobile and desktop viewing
- Created and flushed out the README.
